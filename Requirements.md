# Automated Website Analysis Agent Requirements Document

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an automated agent that can analyze a website from the perspective of a defined user persona. The agent will provide a detailed report of the persona's experience and thought process as they navigate the site.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Persona-Driven Navigation
- The agent must receive a user persona as input, including:
  - Key attributes
  - Interests
  - Needs
  - Goals
- The persona will guide the agent's behavior and decision-making throughout the website analysis.

### 2. Autonomous Website Exploration
- The agent should autonomously navigate the website starting from a given URL.
- The agent will click links and buttons as a human user would.
- Navigation choices should be driven by the defined persona and the content/design of the website.

### 3. Combined Textual and Visual Analysis
- The agent must consider both textual content and visual layout of each webpage.
- It should extract and process both types of information to understand the page's content and design.

### 4. Persona-Specific Summarization
- On each page visited, the agent should generate a summary of the page's content from the perspective of the given persona, capturing:
  - What the persona liked/disliked about the page (textually and visually).
  - The reasoning behind the persona's clicks and actions, linking these actions to persona attributes and specific website elements.
  - The persona's expectations for the next page or action.
  - The persona's overall impression of the current page.

### 5. Memory and Context
- The agent must maintain a memory of its navigation history, including summaries of previously visited pages.
- This memory should inform the agent's current decisions and provide context for its overall understanding of the website's usability for the persona.
- The memory mechanism must be efficient and able to handle the analysis of websites with many pages.

### 6. Detailed Report Generation
- The agent should generate a comprehensive report documenting the persona's journey through the website, including:
  - A chronological walkthrough of the persona's navigation path.
  - For each page visited, a structured summary (likes/dislikes, reasoning, expectations, impression).
  - A clear explanation of why the agent took specific actions, connecting the persona's attributes, the website's design, and the agent's navigation choices.
  - A final conclusion summarizing the persona's overall experience and providing insights into the website's effectiveness for that specific persona.

### 7. Scalability
- The agent should be designed to handle websites with a substantial number of pages and complex navigation structures.

### 8. Robustness
- The agent should be robust enough to handle common website issues, such as:
  - Broken links
  - Slow loading times
  - Unexpected page layouts

## Deliverables
- A working script that performs the website analysis as specified.
- Clear instructions for running the script.
- Sample persona definitions.
- Example website URLs for testing.
- Sample reports generated by the script.
- Documentation explaining the design choices, memory management strategy, and any dependencies.

## Iterative Exploration
- The solution will iterate through the website any number of times, like a real user, until:
  - A specific ending call to action (e.g., demo, contact request) is clicked on the site.
  - The agent decides it has sufficient data to satisfy its needs based on the persona.
  - The website does not have what the persona is looking for.

## Feedback Mechanism
- The agent should provide feedback on the steps and decision process, including decisions based on website content, structure, and design.

## Technical Requirements
- Python-based implementation
- LangChain integration
- Playwright for web automation
- Anthropic's Claude for analysis
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Error handling and recovery
- Efficient token usage
