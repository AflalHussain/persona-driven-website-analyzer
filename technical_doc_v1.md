# Technical Documentation: Automated Website Analysis Agent

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Core Components
- **PersonaAgent**: Main agent class responsible for website analysis
- **WebCrawler**: Handles web page content extraction and screenshot capture
- **RateLimitedLLM**: Manages API rate limiting for LLM interactions
- **NavigationMemory**: Maintains state during website exploration

### 1.2 Design Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Used for monitoring navigation progress and state changes
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented for different analysis strategies based on persona types
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating different types of analysis reports

## 2. Memory Management

### 2.1 Navigation Memory
The system implements a sophisticated memory management strategy through the NavigationMemory class, which tracks:
- Visited URLs
- Page summaries
- Key insights
- Satisfaction scores
- Navigation path
- Found CTAs

### 2.2 Content Processing
Content processing is optimized through:
- Text preprocessing to reduce token usage
- Selective content storage
- Memory cleanup after analysis completion

## 3. Dependencies

### 3.1 Core Dependencies
- `playwright`: Web automation and screenshot capture
- `httpx`: Async HTTP client for API calls
- `PyYAML`: Configuration file parsing
- `python-dotenv`: Environment variable management
- `Pillow`: Image processing
- `logging`: System logging

### 3.2 API Dependencies
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Used for content analysis and decision making
  - Rate limiting implementation: 2 requests per minute

## 4. Analysis Strategy

### 4.1 Content Analysis
The system uses a structured approach to analyze web pages:
- Visual analysis
- Content relevance
- Persona alignment
- Action recommendations

### 4.2 Visual Analysis
Visual analysis includes:
- Layout assessment
- Navigation structure
- Design elements
- CTA placement

## 5. Data Flow

### 5.1 Analysis Pipeline
1. URL validation
2. Content extraction
3. Screenshot capture
4. Content preprocessing
5. LLM analysis
6. Report generation

### 5.2 Report Generation
Reports include:
- Page summaries
- Navigation insights
- Visual analysis
- Persona-specific recommendations

## 6. Configuration Management

### 6.1 Environment Variables
Required environment variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### 6.2 Persona Configuration
Personas are defined in YAML format with:
- Name
- Interests
- Needs
- Goals

## 7. Error Handling

### 7.1 Recovery Strategies
- Rate limit handling
- Connection retry logic
- Content extraction fallbacks
- Memory cleanup on failure

### 7.2 Logging
Comprehensive logging implementation:
- **Info level**: Navigation progress
- **Debug level**: Content processing details
- **Error level**: Critical failures
- **Warning level**: Rate limiting and retries

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Optimization Strategies
- Content preprocessing to reduce token usage
- Selective screenshot capture
- Memory cleanup during navigation
- Rate limit management

### 8.2 Resource Management
- Screenshot cleanup after analysis
- Memory clearance between pages
- API rate limiting
- Connection pooling

## 9. Future Improvements
1. Implement async content processing
2. Add caching layer for repeated analyses
3. Enhance visual analysis capabilities
4. Implement more sophisticated memory management
5. Add support for multiple LLM providers
