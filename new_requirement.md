Performance optimization:
1. Individual persona’s need to run in parallel without a delay between LLM API calls. Can you a different model or other solution here if needed.
2. Update status messages in the API to me more “UI” friendly: building focus group, list each persona same and it’s status (like running or complete, building report, etc.



Focus Group Reporting:
1. Improve the final report. Focus on business value insights instead of technical. Add detailed user journey analysis, Add actionable business recommendations. Example business-focused reporting:
Executive Summary:

Call-to-Action (CTA) Effectiveness:
* Which CTAs were noticed
* Which were clicked and why

Individual Journey Details:
- Persona background

3. Persona Navigation Improvements: Right now, each agent seems to navigate all pages to meet it’s max. But it goes to pages like: login, terms-conditions, etc,. So it’s not acting as a real user in terms of navigation choices. We need to get the persona agent to better emulate a user. The individual persona agent may need better analysis of:
Better Content Relevance Analysis:
• Track specific keywords/phrases that resonate with persona
• Note when content directly addresses persona's goals/needs
• Flag misaligned messaging or irrelevant content
• Identify if technical level matches persona's expertise
Enhanced Decision Making:
• More nuanced "next click" logic based on:
• Content relevance to goals
• Information scent
• Clear call-to-actions
• Logical user flow
• Better exit triggers when content isn't relevant
Improved Memory/Context:
• Remember what's been learned on previous pages
• Track if questions are being answered
• Note when same information is repeated
• Build understanding of site's overall value proposition
Goal Progress Tracking:
• Clear measurement of progress toward persona's goals
• Identify when goals can/cannot be achieved
• Note missing information needed for decisions
• Track completion of user intent
Value Analysis:
• Better evaluation of value propositions
• Match features/benefits to persona needs
• Assess if pricing (if present) aligns with expectations
• Note missing critical information
